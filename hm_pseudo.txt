Pseudo code for Hangman game:

Descriptive:

Hangman is a guessing game between a user's input (one person or a group of people) and  a computer.  The computer will randomly choose a word in a given subject (theme).  In this case, the theme will be Chess.  The user will try to guess each letter of the hidden word.  The hidden word is represented by a group of dashes. If a letter chosen is correct (win), the letter  then replaces the corresponding dash.  Eventually the word is spelled out and the game is over. The game restarts with a new word, and it begins over.
